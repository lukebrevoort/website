# Branch Protection Setup Guide

## Step 1: Navigate to Branch Protection Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/lukebrevoort/website`
2. Click **Settings** (top menu bar)
3. Click **Branches** (left sidebar)
4. Click **Add rule** button

## Step 2: Configure Branch Protection Rule

### Basic Settings
- **Branch name pattern:** `main`
- ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - ‚úÖ **Require approvals:** 1
  - ‚úÖ **Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed**
  - ‚úÖ **Require review from code owners** (if you have CODEOWNERS file)

### Status Checks (Required)
- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

**Select these status checks:**
- ‚úÖ `Continuous Integration` (from ci.yml)
- ‚úÖ `Quick Lint & Type Check` (from quick-lint.yml)  
- ‚úÖ `Test Key Features` (from feature-tests.yml)

### Additional Protection (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB**
- ‚ùå **Allow force pushes** (keep disabled)
- ‚ùå **Allow deletions** (keep disabled)

### Admin Settings
- ‚ùå **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** (recommended for teams)
- ‚úÖ **Include administrators** (enforce rules for all users)

## Step 3: Verify Setup

After saving the rule:

1. Create a test branch: `git checkout -b test-branch-protection`
2. Make a small change and push
3. Create a pull request to `main`
4. Verify that the required status checks appear
5. Confirm you cannot merge until all checks pass

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# Then configure branch protection via command line

gh api repos/lukebrevoort/website/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["Continuous Integration","Quick Lint & Type Check","Test Key Features"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}' \
  --field restrictions=null
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Review failed builds and common issues
- Monitor workflow performance and optimization opportunities
- Check security audit results

### Monthly Tasks  
- Update Node.js version in workflows if needed
- Review and update required status checks
- Analyze workflow usage and costs

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Required status check not found"
- Ensure the workflow has run at least once
- Check that the job names match exactly
- Verify workflows are on the main branch

### Workflows not triggering
- Check that files are in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Verify YAML syntax is valid
- Ensure proper permissions are set

### Build failures
- Check for environment variable requirements
- Verify Node.js version compatibility
- Review dependency installation issues

## Status Check Hierarchy

### Tier 1 (Critical - Block Merge)
- `Continuous Integration` - Core CI pipeline
- `Quick Lint & Type Check` - Basic code quality

### Tier 2 (Important - Recommend)
- `Test Key Features` - Application functionality
- `Security Audit` - Vulnerability scanning

### Tier 3 (Optional - Monitor)
- `Build Application` - Deployment readiness
- `Code Analysis` - Quality metrics
- `Performance Checks` - Optimization insights

## Success Criteria

After setup, every pull request will:
1. ‚úÖ Pass linting and type checking
2. ‚úÖ Build successfully 
3. ‚úÖ Pass feature validation tests
4. ‚úÖ Have no critical security vulnerabilities
5. ‚úÖ Require human review and approval
6. ‚úÖ Maintain main branch stability

This ensures high code quality and prevents broken code from reaching production! üöÄ
